NetApp perfstat wrapper

SYNOPSIS

  xnperfstat [-h] [-d] [-n] [-r] [-u] -m {perf|conf|<perfstat options>} <filer>

DESCRIPTION

xnperfstat is a wrapper for NetApp's perfstat tool. It is intended to allow for streamlined 
invocation of perfstat and, from cron, to collect continuous perfstat samples (which NetApp
can use to compare a filer's state before some event of interest takes place).

There are three use cases xnperfstat:

 + Collect perfstat data on a regular basis
   Unattended fashion (via cron). This mode is specified with the -m flag and the perf or
   conf parameters. In these modes, perfstat output may be redirected to stdout, or, if 
   rotation is enabled, automagically redirected to a file in a ring which maintains up to
   a number of samples at any given point in time. Older samples are discarded as new ones
   are generated. Lower indexes imply newer samples.

 + Collect perfstat data for a open NetApp Support case
   This mode is specified with the -t flag, which accepts (but does not verify) a NetApp
   Support case number and requires custom perfstat parameters via the -m flag. Rotation
   is automatically enabled and output is redirected to a ring which maintains up to a 
   number of samples at any given point in time. Older samples are discarded as new ones
   are generated. Lower indexes imply newer samples.

 + Collect perfstat data as a one-off
   This mode outputs to stdout by default unless the -o flag is specified. Rotation is
   disabled in this mode

When rotation is enabled, files are stored in /local/data/filer/data/perfstat in a rotating
ring (older filers are discarded as new ones are created).

Its behavior is directed and modified via options. Some of them really only make sense when
run from cron.

 + -c path to xnperfstat configuration file.

 + -d runs xnperfstat in debug mode.

 + -m direct the capture mode, performance perf, configuration conf, and custom (which is
      selected when neither of the other two is used and perfstat options are passed). In
      custom mode, a quote string can be passed that is fed to perfstat (for perfstat 
      options -p, -t and -i); it is useful when NetApp requests a specific set of parameters
      be passed to perfstat. All authentication parameters are still handled automatically.

 + -n causes xnperfstat to submit passive tests results to Nagios (as perfstat service
      description)

 + -o <output_file> causes xnperfstat to dump perfstat output to <output_file>. This flag
      is not allowed when rotation is enabled (-r) or when a NetApp Support case number if
      provided (-t).

 + -r causes xnperfstat to rotate perfstat output files.

 + -t <NAcase> provides a NetApp Support case number, which is used to generate the output
      file name (perfstat.now-<NAcase>.<index>).

 + -u causes xnperfstat to unlock; when xnperfstat runs in a given mode (see below) and for
      a give filer, it creates a lock file so as to avoid pileups of perfstat running
      against one filer. If xnperfstat encounters an error condition it cannot handle, it
      will leave the lock behind to force operator intervention.

CONFIGURATION

The xnperfstat configuration file specifies default options. It is a simple text file
(really, a shell script defining some variable xnperfstat uses to set values.

Currently this file is at /local/data/filer/etc/xnperfstat.cfg. Edit NAPERFSW_CONFIG to
change this location.

XNPERFSW_OPTS: defines authentication options for perfstat
               default: -S -s i,/root/.ssh/perfstat_dsa -F
NAPERFSW_PERF_LEVELS: number of performance data samples to keep
                      default: 168 (1 week; 30 min samples)
NAPERFSW_CONF_LEVELS: number of configuration data samples to keep
                      default: 14 (2 weeks; daily samples)
NAPERFSW_PERF_OPTS: perfstat performance collection parameters
                    default: -p -t 5 -i 4,1
NAPERFSW_CONF_OPTS: perfstat configuration collection parameters
                    default: -c -t 1 -i 1
DEF_PERFSTAT_LEVELS: default number of perfstat samples to keep for NOW
                     default: 25

EXAMPLES

# xnperfstat -m "-i 1 -t 1" nap10001

Performs a perfstat run with the custom perfstat parameters -i 1 -t 1. The perfstat output
is sent to stdout. Redirect to taste (or use -o).

# xnperfstat -m "-t 30 -i 1" nap10004
Performs a perfstat run with the specific parameters "-m 30 -i 1" and sends the output to
stdout. Redirect to taste.
